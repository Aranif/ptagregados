In C there are what are called dynamic lists, they can be generated, deleted and modified. 
It has endless uses. In this case a simple list has been used, but there are: Circular lists, doubly linked lists and tree lists. Depending on the type of list, fewer or more pointers will be used.

The structures will allow us to create variables with fields that we can modify at run time.

Note: You must install "make" in Ubuntu, if you donÂ´t have it.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install make
